/**
 * Bingo is a children’s game of chance, sometimes played by adults for fun or
 * money. Each player has a card of numbers arranged in a five-by-five grid with
 * five randomly-chosen numbers from 1 to 15 in the first column, from 16 to 30
 * in the second column, 31 to 45 in the third column, 46 to 60 in the fourth
 * column, and 61 to 75 in the fifth column; the central space is “free” and is
 * considered to be occupied. Then a caller randomly calls numbers from 1 to 75
 * without replacement, each player marking the corresponding number, if it is
 * present on their card, as occupied. The first player to have five occupied
 * numbers in a row horizontally, in a column vertically, or along either of the
 * two major diagonals is the winner.
 * 
 * What is the average number of calls required before a single card achieves
 * bingo? In a large game with five hundred cards in play, what is the average
 * number of calls required before any card achieves bingo?
